/*
SQL Project : Data Cleaning

We have dataset of layoff from Kaggle. In this project, at first we try to clean data as this dataset contain messed up, duplicate, and unmanaged data. 


*/

-- Let's look into data


Select *
From PortfolioProject..layoffs


/*
What are we doing in this project?
1. check for duplicates and remove any
2. standardize data and fix errors
3. Look at null values and see what
4. remove any columns and rows that are not necessary

-- Removing Duplicates

-- 2. Standardize Data

Select * From PortfolioProject..layoffs

Select Distinct industry,count(*) as indu_count

From PortfolioProject..layoffs
Where company = 'Airbnb';  -- it looks like airbnb is a travle (industry), but this isn't just populated enough

/*
So What can we do here?
 => Write a query that if there is another row with same company, it will update it to the non-null industry values
 makes it easy so if there were thousands we wouldn't have to manually chech then all

*/


Update PortfolioProject..layoffs
Set industry = NULL
Where industry = 'NULL' -- not there are all null


-- now we need to populate those nulls if possible

-- 4. remove any columns and rows we need to


SELECT *
